# GroupChatApp
690 Final Project
Arman Husic

This is the final iteration of my Group Chat Application.
      The first iteration of the app had only a single view. and anonymous users. 
      The final version of the application has google sign in and authentication with firebase
      as well as the ability to make groups to organize conversations beyond a single chat view. 
For this project I followed youtube tutorials by Gary Tokman and Wilson Balderama as well as the 
Firebase documentation on Real-time database settings, and Google Sign In and Authentication.
